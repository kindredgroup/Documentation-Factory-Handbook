# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

ADRs record **why we made a decision**, not how we implemented it.

## Rules
- ADRs are immutable once Accepted (changes happen via a new ADR that supersedes it)
- Use sequential numbering (ADR-001, ADR-002, …)
- Every slice that depends on an architectural choice must reference the ADR

## Index
- ADR-007: <title>
